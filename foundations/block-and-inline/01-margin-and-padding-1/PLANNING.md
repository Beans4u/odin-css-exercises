# Atomic Commit planning
This document outlines a planned workflow for this exercise, with carefully-planned atomic commits to follow Git best practices. 

## Stage 1 - Commit this doc
Add commit workflow planning document

Create planning.md to determine the intended Git commit workflow, following the seven rules of a great commit message.

## Stage 2 - Determine constraints of assignment
 ### Objective: 
 - Edit `style.css` so divs match desired-outcome image.
 - Don't fuss to make pixel-perfect with desired-outcome image, use tools to get relatively close.

 ### Constraints:
 - Edit CSS only where instructed in the file.  
 - Only change values of `margin` and `padding`.
 - Don't remove properties in CSS.
 - Don't touch the HTML.
 - Div `.three` alignment must use `margin` (not `float`, `flexbox`, others).

## Stage 3 - Plan commits
 1. Add commit workflow planning document
    - Create planning.md to determine the intended atomic Git commit workflow, following the seven rules of a great commit message.

 2. Set inner spacing for divs .one and .three
    - Aligns with design specs.

 3. Apply 12px margin to div one
    - Aligns with design specs.

 4. Set bottom margin of div .two for vertical spacing
    - Aligns with design specs.

 5. Align div .three to the right
    - Aligns with design specs.
