# Commit planning
This document outlines a planned workflow for this exercise, with carefully-planned atomic commits to follow Git best practices. 

Troubleshooting fixes means I'll have to commit reactively. I've prepared some templates below for potential commits:

## Stage 1 - Commit this doc
Add commit workflow planning document

Create planning.md to determine the intended Git commit workflow, following the seven rules of a great commit message.

## Stage 2 - Fix cascade errors

### V1 template
Fix CSS specificity issue affecting (element)

Higher-specificity selector was overriding intended styles. Adjust selector to ensure correct styles are applied.

### V2 template
Fix CSS rule affecting (element)

Move declaration block to ensure it's applied after conflicting rules.
