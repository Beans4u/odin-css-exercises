# Descendant Combinator
>Copied and reworked README to condense text into assignment constraints:

## Objective:
Apply styles to elements that are descendants of another element, without affecting non-descendant elements.

## Constraints:  
Use either type or class selectors.

The properties you need to add are:  

* If `p` is descendent of `div`:
  - yellow background
  - red text
  - font size of 20px
  - center aligned

## Desired Outcome
