# Chaining Selectors  
>Copied and reworked README to condense text into assignment constraints:

## Objective:  
Chain the selectors for both elements so that each have a unique style applied, despite using a shared class selector.

The properties you need to add to each element are:

* Element with classes `avatar` and `proportioned`:  
  - width: 300 pixels
  - height (to maintain aspect ratio)

* Element with classes `avatar` and `distorted`:  
  - width 200 pixels wide
  - height 2x width

## Desired Outcome:

### Self Check:  
  - Are the selectors properly chained for each rule?
  - Does the `proportioned` image retain its proportions?
  - Does the `distorted` image look distorted?
