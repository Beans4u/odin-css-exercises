# Atomic Commit Planning
This document outlines a planned workflow for this exercise, with carefully-planned atomic commits to follow Git best practices as directed by The Odin Project: [Commit Messages](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-commit-messages) lesson.

## Commit Message Workflow Plan

**Commit 1:**\
Add atomic commit workflow planning document

Create PLANNING.md to plan atomic commits and message format before starting work on this exercise.

**Commit 2:**\
Set styles specified in exercise requirements


# Grouping Selectors
>Copied and reworked README to condense text into assignment constraints:

## Objective:
give two elements each a unique class name, then 
add rules for styles that both elements share + unique styles. 
Refer to image to determine what elements are unique, which are in common.

The properties you need to add to each element are:

- **The first element**: 
    - black background
    - white text

- **The second element**:
    - yellow background

- **Both elements**: 
    - font size 28px
    - font-family `Helvetica`,`"Times New Roman"`, `sans-serif`

## Desired Outcome

### Self Check
- Each element has a unique class name
- Use the grouping selector for repeating styles
- Separate rules for styles unique to each element
